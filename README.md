# Python Basics

This repository holds multiple .py files, each dedicated for important concept and data types in python. The codes are easy to read and has detailed comments about how a function or method is working. Copy and paste the codes in your interpreter to work with it.<br>
I would suggest to go through the other codes and study about it, before going through the mini "Project" codes.

### Pre-requisite
<ul>
  <li> You need to install Python on your system. </li>
  <li> It is better to have Python interpreter to run the code. Some codes may show error in python powershell. </li>
  <li> If you don't have any interpreter install/ facing issues installing one, you can use google collab to run the codes. </li>
</ul>
